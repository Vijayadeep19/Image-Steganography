# Image Steganography

Image Steganography is a project focused on hiding secret information within digital images. Using this tool, users can embed and extract hidden messages or data from images securely.

## Features

- **Embed Messages**: Hide text messages within images without distorting the visible quality of the image.
- **Extract Messages**: Retrieve hidden messages from encoded images.
- **Secure Encoding**: Utilize advanced algorithms to ensure the hidden data is not easily detectable.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified and intuitive interface for embedding and extracting messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pillow` for image processing.
  - Other libraries for encryption or data transformation (e.g., `numpy` or `cryptography`, if applicable).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vijayadeep19/Image-Steganography.git
   cd Image-Steganography
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Embedding a Message**:
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python embed_message.py
     ```
   - Provide the path to the image, the secret message, and the output file name.

2. **Extracting a Message**:
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python extract_message.py
     ```
   - Provide the path to the encoded image to retrieve the hidden message.

### Example

To embed a message:
```bash
python embed_message.py --input example.png --message "Secret Message" --output encoded.png
```

To extract a message:
```bash
python extract_message.py --input encoded.png
```
